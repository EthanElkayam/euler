Welcome to Euler's Game Repository!
The perfect game to memorize the important constant 'e' (Euler's number).

--*THE GAME IS JUST A FUN 1-DAY PROJECT AND SHOULD NOT REPRESENT A REAL PROJECT*--

Notes:
Due to the fact that the data is processed and sent to the database
all on the client side i had to obfuscate the files to stop very easy method manipulations :(

(Anyways the code is not impressive so its not mutch of a loss:
plain javascript for processing data and some HTML manipulation
as well as to send data to the database after each highscore-worthy attempt).

For the database im using the NoSQL database 'firestore'
due to its simplicity and ease of use.

Have fun playing!
